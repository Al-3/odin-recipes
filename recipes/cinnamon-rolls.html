            <li>Heat milk in a small saucepan until just hot to touch or a few bubbles form around the edge. Remove from heat and stir in margarine until melted; set aside. </li>
            <li>Combine 2 1/4 cups flour, white sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add milk mixture, water, and egg; beat well. Add remaining 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. </li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>While dough is resting, mix together brown sugar, margarine, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. </li>
